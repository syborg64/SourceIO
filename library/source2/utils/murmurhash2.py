        # Explanation: We need to keep it 32-bit. There are a few rules:
        # 1. Inputs to >> must be truncated, it never overflows
        # 2. Inputs to * must be truncated, it may overflow
        # 3. Inputs to ^ may be overflowed, it overflows if any input was overflowed
        # 4. The end result must be truncated
        # Therefore:
        # b = k * m -> may overflow, we truncate it because b >> r cannot take overflowed data
        # c = b ^ (b >> r) -> never overflows, as b is truncated and >> never does
        # h = (c * m) ^ (h * m) -> both inputs to ^ may overflow, but since ^ can take it, we truncate once afterwards.

    # Handle the last few bytes of the input array
    if x > 0:
        if x > 2:
            h ^= input[o + 2] << 16
        if x > 1:
            h ^= input[o + 1] << 8
        h = ((h ^ input[o]) * m) & 0xFFFFFFFF

    # Do a few final mixes of the hash to ensure the last few
    # bytes are well incorporated

    # Original:
    # h ^= h >> 13;
    # h *= m;
    # h ^= h >> 15;

    h = ((h ^ (h >> 13)) * m) & 0xFFFFFFFF
    return (h ^ (h >> 15))
